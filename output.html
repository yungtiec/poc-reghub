<p>Updated Small Firm Template</p><p>[Firm Name] </p><p>Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Program:  </p><p>Compliance and Supervisory Procedures</p><p>UPDATED AS OF MONTH DAY, YEAR</p><p>This template is provided to assist small firms in fulfilling their responsibilities to establish an Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Program as required by the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) and its implementing regulations and FINRA Rule 3310 (AML Compliance Program). Nothing in this template creates any new requirements for AML programs. <strong>Furthermore, following this template does not guarantee compliance with AML Program requirements or provide a safe harbor from regulatory responsibility. </strong>There is no exemption from the AML rules for small broker-dealers. </p><p>Your firm’s AML program should be “risk-based.” That means that the program’s AML policies, procedures and internal controls should be designed to address the risk of money laundering specific to your firm. Your firm can identify that risk by looking at the type of customers it serves, where its customers are located, and the types of services it offers. It is a good practice to develop a written analysis of your firm’s money laundering and terrorist financing risk and how your firm’s AML procedures manage that risk. This “risk-assessment” will help to ensure that the AML program is the right one for your firm and is a useful tool for demonstrating to your firm’s examiner that the firm used a reasonable approach for designing its AML program.</p><p>In addition, where certain AML rules may be inapplicable due to the limited nature of your firm’s business, FINRA expects your firm to have internal controls in place to identify when circumstances change in such a way as to trigger previously inapplicable AML requirements and to amend your AML policies and procedures to accurately reflect all AML requirements that are applicable to your business. For example, a firm with no customer accounts within the definition of the Customer Identification Program (CIP) rule would not be expected to have a CIP. However, the firm must have procedures in place to identify when the firm’s business activities have shifted in such a way as to require compliance with the CIP rule. In addition, notwithstanding the fact that the firm does not have accounts for CIP purposes, the firm is expected to identify and develop procedures for any additional AML requirements that do apply (<em>e.g.</em>, suspicious activity monitoring and reporting).</p><p>The language in this template is provided only as a <strong>helpful starting point</strong> to walk you through developing your firm’s program. If any of the language does not adequately address your firm’s business situation in any respect, you will need to prepare your own language. <strong>You </strong>are responsible for ensuring that the program fits your firm’s risk level and that you implement the program.  </p><p>TEXT EXAMPLES are provided to give you sample language that you can modify, as necessary, to fit your firm’s needs in creating your firm’s program.  </p><p>Material in <em>italics</em> provides instructions and citations to the relevant rules, and other resources that you can use to develop your firm’s program.  </p><p>The <a href="http://www.finra.org/RulesRegulation/IssueCenter/Anti-MoneyLaundering/index.htm">FINRA AML web page</a> includes important information and links to other websites with useful information.

Generally, money laundering occurs in three stages. Cash first enters the financial system at the &quot;placement&quot; stage, where the cash generated from criminal activities is converted into monetary instruments, such as money orders or traveler's checks, or deposited into accounts at financial institutions. At the &quot;layering&quot; stage, the funds are transferred or moved into other accounts or other financial institutions to further separate the money from its criminal origin. At the &quot;integration&quot; stage, the funds are reintroduced into the economy and used to purchase legitimate assets or to fund other criminal activities or legitimate businesses.  </p><p>Although cash is rarely deposited into securities accounts, the securities industry is unique in that it can be used to launder funds obtained elsewhere, and to generate illicit funds within the industry itself through fraudulent activities. Examples of types of fraudulent activities include insider trading, market manipulation, ponzi schemes, cybercrime and other investment-related fraudulent activity.</p><p>Terrorist financing may not involve the proceeds of criminal conduct, but rather an attempt to conceal either the origin of the funds or their intended use, which could be for criminal purposes. Legitimate sources of funds are a key difference between terrorist financiers and traditional criminal organizations. In addition to charitable donations, legitimate sources include foreign government sponsors, business ownership and personal employment. Although the motivation differs between traditional money launderers and terrorist financiers, the actual methods used to fund terrorist operations can be the same as or similar to methods used by other criminals to launder funds. Funding for terrorist attacks does not always require large sums of money and the associated transactions may not be complex.</p><p>Our AML policies, procedures and internal controls are designed to ensure compliance with all applicable BSA regulations and FINRA rules and will be reviewed and updated on a regular basis to ensure appropriate policies, procedures and internal controls are in place to account for both changes in regulations and changes in our business.</p><p><em>Rules: 31 C.F.R. § 1023.210; FINRA Rule 3310.</em></p><h2>2.

Voluntary Information Sharing With Other Financial Institutions Under USA PATRIOT Act Section 314(b)</h3><p><em>BSA regulations permit financial institutions to share information with other financial institutions under the protection of a safe harbor if certain procedures are followed.

Joint Filing of SARs by Broker-Dealers and Other Financial Institutions</strong></p><p><em>The obligation to identify and properly report a suspicious transaction and to timely file a SAR rests separately with each broker-dealer. However, one SAR may be filed for a suspicious activity by all broker-dealers involved in a transaction (so long as the report filed contains all relevant and required information) if the SAR is jointly filed. In addition, if a broker-dealer and another financial institution that is subject to the SAR regulations are involved in the same suspicious transaction, the financial institution may also file a SAR jointly (so long as the report filed contains all relevant and required information). For example, a broker-dealer and an insurance company may file one SAR with respect to suspicious activity involving the sale of variable insurance products.  Disclosures that are made for the purposes of jointly filing a SAR are protected by the safe harbor contained in the SAR regulations. The financial institutions that jointly file a SAR shall each be separately responsible for maintaining a copy of the SAR and should maintain their own SAR supporting documentation in accordance with BSA recordkeeping requirements.

As part of its enforcement efforts, OFAC publishes a list of Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons (SDN list), which includes names of companies and individuals who are connected with the sanctions targets. U.S. persons are prohibited from dealing with SDNs wherever they are located, and all SDN assets must be blocked.

Verifying Information </h3><p><em>Describe how you will verify customers’ identities using the information described above.

Among the risks to consider are the various types of accounts maintained by the firm, the various methods the firm uses to open accounts, the various types of identifying information available, and the firm’s size, location and customer base. If you believe that some of these risk factors increase the likelihood that you will need more information to know the true identity of your customers, you should determine what additional identifying information might be necessary for a reasonable belief that you know the true identity of your customer and when such additional information should be obtained</em>.</p><p>TEXT EXAMPLE: Based on the risk, and to the extent reasonable and practicable, we will ensure that we have a reasonable belief that we know the true identity of our customers by using risk-based procedures to verify and document the accuracy of the information we get about our customers. [<em>Name</em>] will analyze the information we obtain to determine whether the information is sufficient to form a reasonable belief that we know the true identity of the customer (<em>e.g.</em>, whether the information is logical or contains inconsistencies).   </p><p>We will verify customer identity through documentary means, non-documentary means or both. [<em>Tailor the sentence to your actual situation.</em>] We will use documents to verify customer identity when appropriate documents are available. In light of the increased instances of identity fraud, we will supplement the use of documentary evidence by using the non-documentary means described below whenever necessary. We may also use non-documentary means, if we are still uncertain about whether we know the true identity of the customer. In verifying the information, we will consider whether the identifying information that we receive, such as the customer’s name, street address, zip code, telephone number (if provided), date of birth and Social Security number, allow us to determine that we have a reasonable belief that we know the true identity of the customer (<em>e.g.</em>, whether the information is logical or contains inconsistencies). </p><p>Appropriate documents for verifying the identity of customers include the following: </p><ul><li>For an individual, an unexpired government-issued identification evidencing nationality or residence and bearing a photograph or similar safeguard, such as a driver’s license or passport; and</li><li>For a person other than an individual, documents showing the existence of the entity, such as certified articles of incorporation, a government-issued business license, a partnership agreement or a trust instrument.</li></ul><p>We understand that we are not required to take steps to determine whether the document that the customer has provided to us for identity verification has been validly issued and that we may rely on a government-issued identification as verification of a customer’s identity. If, however, we note that the document shows some obvious form of fraud, we must consider that factor in determining whether we can form a reasonable belief that we know the customer’s true identity.</p><p>We will use the following non-documentary methods of verifying identity:</p><ul><li>Independently verifying the customer’s identity through the comparison of information provided by the customer with information obtained from a consumer reporting agency, public database or other source <em>[identify reporting agency, database, etc.]</em>; </li><li>Checking references with other financial institutions; or </li><li>Obtaining a financial statement.</li><li>[<em>add other non-documentary methods, if applicable</em>]</li></ul><p>We will use non-documentary methods of verification when: </p><p>(1) the customer is unable to present an unexpired government-issued identification document with a photograph or other similar safeguard; </p><p>(2) the firm is unfamiliar with the documents the customer presents for identification verification; </p><p>(3) the customer and firm do not have face-to-face contact; and </p><p>(4) there are other circumstances that increase the risk that the firm will be unable to verify the true identity of the customer through documentary means.  </p><p>We will verify the information within a reasonable time before or after the account is opened. Depending on the nature of the account and requested transactions, we may refuse to complete a transaction before we have verified the information, or in some instances when we need more time, we may, pending verification, restrict the types of transactions or dollar amount of transactions. If we find suspicious information that indicates possible money laundering, terrorist financing activity, or other suspicious activity, we will, after internal consultation with the firm's AML Compliance Person, file a SAR in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.</p><p>We recognize that the risk that we may not know the customer’s true identity may be heightened for certain types of accounts, such as an account opened in the name of a corporation, partnership or trust that is created or conducts substantial business in a jurisdiction that has been designated by the U.S. as a primary money laundering jurisdiction, a terrorist concern, or has been designated as a non-cooperative country or territory. We will identify customers that pose a heightened risk of not being properly identified. We will also take the following additional measures that may be used to obtain information about the identity of the individuals associated with the customer when standard documentary methods prove to be insufficient: [<em>Add additional procedures for verifying identity of certain customers, such as obtaining information about beneficial ownership, individuals with authority or control over such account.

Lack of Verification</strong></p><p><em>Describe your procedures</em> <em>for responding to circumstances in which the firm cannot form a reasonable belief that it knows the true identity of a customer.</em></p><p>TEXT EXAMPLE: When we cannot form a reasonable belief that we know the true identity of a customer, we will do the following: (1) not open an account; (2) impose terms under which a customer may conduct transactions while we attempt to verify the customer’s identity; (3) close an account after attempts to verify a customer’s identity fail; and (4) determine whether it is necessary to file a SAR in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.</p><p><em>Rule: 31 C.F.R. § 1023.220(a)(2)(iii)</em>.</p><p><strong>e.	Recordkeeping</strong></p><p>Describe your recordkeeping procedures.</p><p><strong><em> </em></strong></p><p>TEXT EXAMPLE: We will document our verification, including all identifying information provided by a customer, the methods used and results of verification, and the resolution of any discrepancies identified in the verification process. We will keep records containing a description of any document that we relied on to verify a customer’s identity, noting the type of document, any identification number contained in the document, the place of issuance, and if any, the date of issuance and expiration date. With respect to non-documentary verification, we will retain documents that describe the methods and the results of any measures we took to verify the identity of a customer. We will also keep records containing a description of the resolution of each substantive discrepancy discovered when verifying the identifying information obtained. We will retain records of all identification information for five years after the account has been closed; we will retain records made about verification of the customer's identity for five years after the record is made. </p><p><em>Rule: 31 C.F.R. § 1023.220(a)(3).</em></p><h3>f.

Customer Due Diligence Rule</strong></p><p><em>On May 11, 2016, FinCEN adopted a final rule on Customer Due Diligence Requirements for Financial Institutions (CDD Rule) to clarify and strengthen customer due diligence for covered financial institutions, including broker-dealers. The Rule becomes effective on May 11, 2018.</em></p><p><em>In its CDD Rule, FinCEN identifies four components of customer due diligence: (1) customer identification and verification; (2) beneficial ownership identification and verification; (3) understanding the nature and purpose of customer relationships for the purpose of developing a customer risk profile; and (4) conducting ongoing monitoring to identify and report suspicious transactions and, on a risk basis, to maintain and update customer information. As the first component is already an AML program requirement (under the CIP Rule), the CDD Rule focuses on the other three components.</em></p><p><em>Specifically, the CDD Rule focuses particularly on the second component by adding a new requirement that covered financial institutions establish and maintain written procedures as part of their AML programs that are reasonably designed to identify and verify the identities of beneficial owners of legal entity customers, subject to certain exclusions and exemptions. </em></p><p><em>Under the CDD Rule, member firms must obtain from the natural person opening the account on behalf of the legal entity customer, the identity of the beneficial owners of the entity. In addition, that individual must certify, to the best of his or her knowledge, as to the accuracy of the information. FinCEN intends that the legal entity customer identify its ultimate beneficial owner(s) and not “nominees” or “straw men.”  </em></p><p><em>The CDD Rule does not prescribe the form in which member firms must collect the required information, which includes the name, date of birth, address and Social Security number or other government identification number of beneficial owners. Rather, member firms may choose to obtain the information by using FinCEN’s standard certification form in Appendix A of the CDD Rule (at </em><a href="https://www.fincen.gov/resources/filing-information"><em>https://www.fincen.gov/resources/filing-information</em></a><em>) or by another means, provided that the chosen method satisfies the identification requirements in the CDD Rule. In any case, the CDD Rule requires that member firms maintain records of the beneficial ownership information they obtain.</em></p><p><em>Once member firms obtain the required beneficial ownership information, the CDD Rule requires that firms verify the identity of the beneficial owner(s) – in other words, that they are who they say they are – and not their status as beneficial owners through risk-based procedures that include, at a minimum, the elements required for CIP procedures for verifying the identity of individual customers. Such verification must be completed within a reasonable time after account opening. Member firms may rely on the beneficial ownership information supplied by the individual opening the account, provided that they have no knowledge of facts that would reasonably call into question the reliability of that information.</em></p><p><em>The CDD Rule’s requirements with respect to beneficial owners of legal entity customers applies on a prospective basis, that is, only with respect to legal entity customers that open new accounts from the date of the CDD Rule’s implementation. However, member firms should obtain beneficial ownership information for an existing legal entity customer if, during the course of normal monitoring, it receives information that is needed to assess or reevaluate the risk of the customer.</em></p><p><em>The required records to be created and maintained must include: (i) for identification, any identifying information obtained by the member firm pursuant to the beneficial ownership identification requirements of the CDD Rule, including without limitation the certification (if obtained); and (ii) for verification, a description of any document relied on (noting the type, any identification number, place of issuance and, if any, date of issuance and expiration), of any non-documentary methods and the results of any measures undertaken, and the resolution of each substantive discrepancy. In addition to complying with existing SEC and FINRA record retention requirements, member firms must maintain the records collected for identification purposes for a minimum of five years after the account is closed, and for verification purposes, for five years after the record is made.</em></p><p><em>Member firms may rely on the performance by another financial institution (including an affiliate) of the requirements of the CDD Rule with respect to any legal entity customer of  the member firm that is opening, or has opened, an account or has established a similar business relationship with the other financial institution to provide or engage in services, dealings, or other financial transactions, provided that: (1) such reliance is reasonable under the circumstances; (2) the other financial institution is subject to a rule implementing 31 U.S.C. 5318(h) and is regulated by a Federal functional regulator; and (3) the other financial institution enters into a contract requiring it to certify annually to the member firm that it has implemented its AML program, and that it will perform (or its agent will perform) the specified requirements of the member firm’s procedures to comply with the CDD Rule.</em></p><p><em>The CDD Rule also addresses the third and fourth components, which FinCEN states “are already implicitly required for covered financial institutions to comply with their suspicious activity reporting requirements,” by amending the existing AML program rules for covered financial institutions to explicitly require these components to be included in AML programs as a new “fifth pillar.” These requirements are discussed further below.</em></p><p><em>Rules: 31 C.F.R. § 1010.230; 31 C.F.R. § 1023.210(b)(5); FINRA Rule 3310.</em></p><p><em>Resources: </em><a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/05/11/2016-10567/customer-due-diligence-requirements-for-financial-institutions"><em>81 Fed.

To that end, the CDD Rule requires that firms understand the nature and purpose of the customer relationship in order to develop a customer risk profile. The customer risk profile refers to information gathered about a customer to form the baseline against which customer activity is assessed for suspicious transaction reporting. Information relevant to understanding the nature and purpose of the customer relationship may be self-evident and, depending on the facts and circumstances, may include such information as the type of customer, account or service offered, and the customer’s income, net worth, domicile, or principal occupation or business, as well as, in the case of existing customers, the customer’s history of activity. The CDD Rule also does not prescribe a particular form of the customer risk profile. Instead, the CDD Rule states that depending on the firm and the nature of its business, a customer risk profile may consist of individualized risk scoring, placement of customers into risk categories or another means of assessing customer risk that allows firms to understand the risk posed by the customer and to demonstrate that understanding.</em></p><p><em>The CDD Rule also addresses the interplay of understanding the nature and purpose of customer relationships with the ongoing monitoring obligation discussed below. The CDD Rule explains that firms are not necessarily required or expected to integrate customer information or the customer risk profile into existing transaction monitoring systems (for example, to serve as the baseline for identifying and assessing suspicious transactions on a contemporaneous basis). Rather, FinCEN expects firms to use the customer information and customer risk profile as appropriate during the course of complying with their obligations under the BSA in order to determine whether a particular flagged transaction is suspicious.</em></p><p>TEXT EXAMPLE</p><p>We will understand the nature and purpose of customer relationships for the purpose of developing a customer risk profile through the following methods [<em>describe</em>]. </p><p><em>Depending on the facts and circumstances, a customer risk profile may include such information as:</em></p><ul><li><em>The type of customer;</em></li><li><em>The account or service being offered;</em></li><li><em>The customer’s income;</em></li><li><em>The customer’s net worth;</em></li><li><em>The customer’s domicile; </em></li><li><em>The customer’s principal occupation or business; and</em></li><li><em>In the case of existing customers, the customer’s history of activity.</em></li></ul><p><em>Rules: 31 C.F.R. § 1010.230; 31 C.F.R. § 1023.210(b)(5)(i); FINRA Rule 3310.</em></p><p><em>Resources: </em><a href="https://www.fincen.gov/sites/default/files/2016-09/FAQs_for_CDD_Final_Rule_%287_15_16%29.pdf"><em>FIN-2016-G003: Frequently Asked Questions Regarding Customer Due Diligence Requirements for Financial Institutions (7/19/2016)</em></a><em>; </em><a href="http://www.finra.org/industry/notices/17-40"><em>Regulatory Notice 17-40</em></a><em>; Regulatory Notice 18-19.</em></p><ul><li><ol><li><strong>Conducting Ongoing Monitoring to Identify and Report Suspicious Transactions</strong></li></ol></li></ul><p><em>As with the requirement to understand the nature and purpose of the customer relationship, the requirement to conduct ongoing monitoring to identify and report suspicious transactions and, on a risk basis, to maintain and update customer information, including information regarding the beneficial ownership of legal entity customers, merely adopts existing supervisory and regulatory expectations as explicit minimum standards of customer due diligence required for firms’ AML programs.

Due Diligence and Enhanced Due Diligence Requirements for Private Banking Accounts/Senior Foreign Political Figures </h2><p><em>Describe your firm's due diligence program for “private banking” accounts for non-U.S. persons. Firms must have a due diligence program that is reasonably designed to detect and report any known or suspected money laundering conducted through or involving any private banking account maintained by or on behalf of a non-U.S. person, as well as the existence of the proceeds of foreign corruption in any such account. This requirement applies to all private banking accounts for non-U.S. persons, regardless of when they were opened. Accounts requested or maintained by or on behalf of “senior foreign political figures,” which is defined below and includes their immediate family members and close known associates, require enhanced scrutiny. Senior foreign political figures are often referred to as “politically exposed persons” or “PEPs.”</em></p><p><em>A “private banking” account is an account (or any combination of accounts) that requires a minimum aggregate deposit of $1,000,000, is established for one or more individuals and is assigned to or administered or managed by, in whole or in part, an officer, employee or agent of a financial institution acting as a liaison between the financial institution and the direct or beneficial owner of the account.  </em></p><p><em>A “senior foreign political figure” includes a current or former senior official in the executive, legislative, administrative, military or judicial branches of a foreign government (whether elected or not), a senior official of a major foreign political party, or a senior executive of a foreign government-owned commercial enterprise; a corporation, business, or other entity formed by or for the benefit of any such individual; an immediate family member of such an individual; or any individual widely and publicly known (or actually known by the firm) to be a close personal or professional associate of such an individual.  </em></p><p><strong>NOTE: <em>If your firm does not open or maintain private banking accounts, state that this is your firm’s policy. </em></strong></p><p>TEXT EXAMPLE:</p><p>EITHER:</p><p>We will review our accounts to determine whether we offer any private banking accounts and we will conduct due diligence on such accounts. This due diligence will include, at least: (1) ascertaining the identity of all nominal holders and holders of any beneficial ownership interest in the account (including information on those holders' lines of business and sources of wealth); (2) ascertaining the source of funds deposited into the account; (3) ascertaining whether any such holder may be a senior foreign political figure; and (4) detecting and reporting, in accordance with applicable laws and regulations, any known or suspected money laundering, or use of the proceeds of foreign corruption.  </p><p>We will review public information, including information available in Internet databases, to determine whether any private banking account holders are senior foreign political figures. If we discover information indicating that a particular private banking account holder may be a senior foreign political figure, and upon taking additional reasonable steps to confirm this information, we determine that the individual is, in fact, a senior foreign political figure, we will conduct additional enhanced due diligence to detect and report transactions that may involve money laundering or the proceeds of foreign corruption.  </p><p>In so doing, we will consider the risks that the funds in the account may be the proceeds of foreign corruption by determining the purpose and use of the private banking account, location of the account holder(s), source of funds in the account, type of transactions conducted through the account and jurisdictions involved in such transactions. The degree of scrutiny we will apply will depend on various risk factors, including, but not limited to, whether the jurisdiction the senior foreign political figure is from is one in which current or former political figures have been implicated in corruption and the length of time that a former political figure was in office.

The risk of suspicious activity will vary for each firm depending on its size and location and based on its business model and the products and services it offers. Your firm can identify that risk by looking at the type of customers it serves, where its customers are located, and the types of products and services it offers.</em> <em>Given the wide variety of business models employed by small firms, it is paramount that your firm’s monitoring procedures be tailored to your firm’s business and identified risks.

Higher risk accounts and transactions generally need to be subjected to greater scrutiny.  </em></p><p><em>Your procedures should also describe how the firm will monitor for or otherwise identify these “red flags.” Your firm may monitor transactions manually or through automated systems or a combination of the two, as long as the system is reasonably designed to identify and report suspicious activity.

We will file a SAR-SF no later than 30 calendar days after the date of the initial detection of the facts that constitute a basis for filing a SAR. If no suspect is identified on the date of initial detection, we may delay filing the SAR for an additional 30 calendar days pending identification of a suspect, but in no case will the reporting be delayed more than 60 calendar days after the date of initial detection. The phrase “initial detection” does not mean the moment a transaction is highlighted for review. The 30-day (or 60-day) period begins when an appropriate review is conducted and a determination is made that the transaction under review is “suspicious” within the meaning of the SAR requirements.
