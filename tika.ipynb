      "</p>\n",
      "<p>In October 2018, the FATF adopted changes to its Recommendations to explicitly \n",
      "clarify that they apply to financial activities involving virtual assets, and also added \n",
      "two new definitions in the Glossary, “virtual asset” (VA) and “virtual asset service \n",
      "provider” (VASP). The amended FATF Recommendation 15 requires that VASPs be \n",
      "regulated for anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism \n",
      "(AML/CFT) purposes, licenced or registered, and subject to effective systems for \n",
      "monitoring or supervision.  \n",
      "</p>\n",
      "<p>In June 2019, the FATF adopted an Interpretive Note to Recommendation 15 to \n",
      "further clarify how the FATF requirements should apply in relation to VAs and VASPs, \n",
      "in particular with regard to the application of the risk-based approach (RBA) to VA \n",
      "activities or operations and VASPs; supervision or monitoring of VASPs for AML/CFT \n",
      "purposes; licensing or registration; preventive measures, such as customer due \n",
      "diligence, recordkeeping, and suspicious transaction reporting, among others; \n",
      "sanctions and other enforcement measures; and international co-operation. \n",
      "</p>\n",
      "<p>The FATF also adopted the present Guidance1 on the application of the RBA to VAs \n",
      "and VASPs In June 2019. It is intended to help both national authorities in \n",
      "understanding and developing regulatory and supervisory responses to VA activities \n",
      "and VASPs, and to help private sector entities seeking to engage in VA activities, in \n",
      "understanding their AML/CFT obligations and how they can effectively comply with \n",
      "these requirements.  \n",
      "</p>\n",
      "<p>This Guidance outlines the need for countries and VASPs, and other entities involved \n",
      "in VA activities, to understand the ML/TF risks associated with their activities and \n",
      "take appropriate mitigating measures to address them. In particular, the Guidance \n",
      "provides examples of risk indicators that should specifically be considered in a VA \n",
      "context, with an emphasis on factors that would further obfuscate transactions or \n",
      "inhibit VASPs’ ability to identify customers. \n",
      "</p>\n",
      "<p>The Guidance examines how VA activities and VASPs fall within the scope of the FATF \n",
      "Recommendations. It discusses the five types of activities covered by the VASP \n",
      "definition and provides examples of VA-related activities that would fall within the \n",

      "<p>Background \n",
      "</p>\n",
      "<p>1. New technologies, products, and related services have the potential to spur financial \n",
      "innovation and efficiency and improve financial inclusion, but they also create new \n",
      "opportunities for criminals and terrorists to launder their proceeds or finance their illicit \n",
      "activities. The risk-based approach is central to the effective implementation of the revised \n",
      "Financial Action Task Force (FATF) International Standards on Combating Money Laundering \n",
      "and the Financing of Terrorism and Proliferation, which FATF members adopted in 2012, and \n",
      "the FATF therefore actively monitors the risks relating to new technologies. \n",
      "</p>\n",
      "<p>2. In June 2014, the FATF issued Virtual Currencies: Key Definitions and Potential AML/CFT Risks \n",
      "in response to the emergence of virtual currencies and their associated payment mechanisms \n",
      "for providing new methods of transmitting value over the Internet. In June 2015, the FATF \n",
      "issued the Guidance for a Risk-Based Approach to Virtual Currencies (the 2015 VC Guidance) as \n",
      "part of a staged approach to addressing the money laundering and terrorist financing (ML/TF) \n",
      "risks associated with virtual currency payment products and services. \n",
      "</p>\n",
      "<p>3. The 2015 VC Guidance focuses on the points where virtual currency activities intersect with \n",
      "and provide gateways to and from (i.e., the on and off ramps to) the traditional regulated \n",
      "financial system, in particular convertible virtual currency exchangers. In recent years, \n",
      "however, the virtual asset space has evolved to include a range of new products and services, \n",
      "business models, and activities and interactions, including virtual-to-virtual asset transactions. \n",
      "</p>\n",
      "<p>4. In particular, the virtual asset ecosystem has seen the rise of anonymity-enhanced \n",
      "cryptocurrencies (AECs), mixers and tumblers, decentralized platforms and exchanges, and \n",
      "other types of products and services that enable or allow for reduced transparency and \n",
      "increased obfuscation of financial flows, as well as the emergence of other virtual asset \n",
      "business models or activities such as initial coin offerings (ICOs) that present ML/TF risks, \n",
      "including fraud and market manipulation risks. Further, new illicit financing typologies \n",
      "continue to emerge, including the increasing use of virtual-to-virtual layering schemes that \n",
      "attempt to further obfuscate transactions in a comparatively easy, cheap, and secure manner. \n",
      "</p>\n",
      "<p>5. Given the development of additional products and services and the introduction of new types \n",
      "of providers in this space, the FATF recognized the need for further clarification on the \n",
      "application of the Standards to new technologies and providers. In particular, in October 2018, \n",
      "the FATF adopted two new Glossary definitions—“virtual asset” (VA) and “virtual asset service \n",
      "provider” (VASP)—and updated Recommendation 15 (see Annex A). The objectives of those \n",
      "changes were to further clarify the application of the FATF Standards to VA activities and \n",
      "VASPs in order to ensure a level regulatory playing field for VASPs globally and to assist \n",
      "jurisdictions in mitigating the ML/TF risks associated with VA activities and in protecting the \n",
      "integrity of the global financial system. The FATF also clarified that the Standards apply to both \n",
      "virtual-to-virtual and virtual-to-fiat transactions and interactions involving VAs. \n",
      "</p>\n",
      "<p>6. In June 2019, the FATF adopted an Interpretive Note to Recommendation 15 (INR. 15) to \n",
      "further clarify how the FATF requirements should apply in relation to VAs and VASPs, in \n",
      "particular with regard to the application of the risk-based approach to VA activities or \n",
      "operations and VASPs; supervision or monitoring of VASPs for anti-money laundering and \n",

      "order to address the ML/TF risks associated with covered VA activities and VASPs.  \n",

      "<p>9. The Guidance also is intended to help private sector entities seeking to engage in VA activities \n",
      "or operations as defined in the FATF Glossary to better understand their AML/CFT obligations \n",
      "and how they can effectively comply with the FATF requirements. It provides guidelines to \n",

      "the application of preventive measures such as customer due diligence, record-keeping, and \n",
      "suspicious transaction reporting, among other measures. \n",
      "</p>\n",
      "<p>10. The Guidance incorporates the terms adopted by the FATF in October 2018 and readers are \n",

      "(Annex A).  \n",
      "</p>\n",
      "<p>11. The Guidance seeks to explain how the FATF Recommendations should apply to VA activities \n",
      "and VASPs; provides examples, where relevant or potentially most useful; and identifies \n",
      "obstacles to applying mitigating measures alongside potential solutions. It is intended to serve \n",
      "as a complement to Recommendation 15 on New Technologies (R. 15) and its Interpretive \n",
      "Note, which describe the full range of obligations applicable to VASPs as well as to VAs under \n",
      "the FATF Recommendations, including the Recommendations relating to “property,” \n",
      "“proceeds,” “funds,” “funds or other assets,” and other “corresponding value.” In doing so, the \n",
      "Guidance supports the effective implementation of national AML/CFT measures for the \n",
      "regulation and supervision of VASPs (as well as other obliged entities) and the covered VA \n",
      "activities in which they engage and the development of a common understanding of what a \n",
      "risk-based approach to AML/CFT entails. \n",
      "</p>\n",
      "<p>12. While the FATF notes that some governments are considering a range of regulatory responses \n",
      "to VAs and to the regulation of VASPs, many jurisdictions do not yet have in place effective \n",
      "AML/CFT frameworks for mitigating the ML/TF risks associated with VA activities in \n",
      "particular, even as VA activities develop globally and VASPs increasingly operate across \n",
      "jurisdictions. The rapid development, increasing functionality, growing adoption, and global, \n",
      "cross-border nature of VAs therefore makes the urgent action by countries to mitigate the \n",
      "ML/TF risks presented by VA activities and VASPs a key priority of the FATF. While this \n",
      "Guidance is intended to facilitate the implementation of the risk-based approach to covered \n",
      "VA activities and VASPs for AML/CFT purposes, the FATF recognizes that other types of policy \n",

      "individual jurisdictions.  \n",
      "</p>\n",
      "<p>Scope of the Guidance \n",
      "</p>\n",
      "<p>13. The FATF Recommendations require all jurisdictions to impose specified, activities-based \n",
      "AML/CFT requirements on financial institutions (FIs) and designated non-financial businesses \n",
      "and professions (DNFBPs) and ensure their compliance with those obligations. The FATF has \n",

      "countries better understand how they should implement the FATF Standards effectively. \n",

      "<p>14. Further, the Guidance focuses on VAs that are convertible for other funds or value, including \n",
      "both VAs that are convertible to another VA and VAs that are convertible to fiat or that intersect \n",
      "with the fiat financial system, having regard to the VA and VASP definitions. It does not address \n",

      "protection, prudential safety and soundness, tax, anti-fraud or anti-market manipulation \n",
      "issues, network IT security standards, or financial stability concerns). \n",
      "</p>\n",
      "<p>15. The Guidance recognizes that an effective risk-based approach will reflect the nature, diversity, \n",
      "and maturity of a country’s VASP sector, the risk profile of the sector, the risk profile of \n",
      "individual VASPs operating in the sector and the legal and regulatory approach in the country, \n",
      "taking into account the cross-border, Internet-based nature and global reach of most VA \n",
      "activities. The Guidance sets out different elements that countries and VASPs should consider \n",
      "when designing and implementing a risk-based approach. When considering the general \n",
      "principles outlined in the Guidance, national authorities will have to take into consideration \n",
      "their national context, including the supervisory approach and legal framework as well as the \n",
      "risks present in their jurisdiction, again in light of the potentially global reach of VA activities. \n",

      "in financial activities, illicit actors can abuse VASPs engaging in VA activities, for ML, TF, \n",
      "sanctions evasion, fraud, and other nefarious purposes. The 2015 VC Guidance, the 2018 FATF \n",

      "activities. While VAs may provide another form of value for conducting ML and TF, and VA \n",
      "activities may serve as another mechanism for the illegal transfer of value or funds, countries \n",
      "should not necessarily categorize VASPs or VA activities as inherently high ML/TF risks. The \n",

      "framework as well as the implementation of risk-based controls and mitigating measures by \n",
      "VASPs also influence the overall risks and threats associated with covered VA activities. The \n",

      "which competent authorities and VASPs should consider in devising appropriate solutions.  \n",
      "</p>\n",
      "<p>17. The Guidance recognizes that “new” or innovative technologies or mechanisms for engaging in \n",

      "of factors, including products, services, customers, geography, and the strength of the entity’s \n",
      "compliance program. Recommendation 1 sets out the scope of the application of the risk-based \n",

      "AML/CFT regime should be supervised or monitored for compliance with the regime; how \n",
      "those subject to the AML/CFT regime should be required to comply; and consideration of the \n",
      "engagement in customer relationships by VASPs and other obliged entities involved in covered \n",

      "paragraph 2 of INR. 15, countries should identify, assess, and understand the ML/TF risks \n",
      "emerging from this space and focus their AML/CFT efforts on potentially higher-risk VAs, \n",
